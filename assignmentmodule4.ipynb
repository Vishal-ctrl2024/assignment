    "1.Explain the key features of python that makes it a popular choice for programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans= Python is a popular programming language. Its features are:\n",
    " .It is widely used in the industry.\n",
    "\n",
    " . It is widely used in the data university.\n",
    "\n",
    " . There are many libraries present in python where all optimized and well- written code are already kept.\n",
    " .It has huge active community.\n",
    "\n",
    " . Python is very easy to learn as compared to other languages like Javascript, Java, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    " .Python is Object-Oriented programming. Python supports object-oriented language and concepts of classes, object encapsulation, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " Q2.Describe the role of predefined keywords in python and provide example of how they are used in programme?\n",
    "\n",
    " Ans= Python keywords are special reserved and predefined words that have specific meanings and purposes and can't be used for anything but those specific purposes.Keywords are used to define the syntax of the coding. They cannot be used as an identifier, function or variable name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: type, else, while, True, False, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Print(\"hello world\")\n",

    "Q3.Compare and contrast mutable and immutable objects in python with example?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans= MUTABLE OBJECTS\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Mutable objects are those that allow us to change their value or data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Mutable objects are widely used in object-oriented programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "IMMUTABLE OBJECTS\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Immutable objects don't allow us to change their value or data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Immutable objects are common in functional programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarity between Mutable and Immutable objects is that both Mutable and Immutable data types can be used to store data and can be accessed using the same syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of mutable objects.\n",
